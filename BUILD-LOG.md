# Kestrel Gives — Build Log

A running, honest record of how this project was built, for the case study. Times are US Eastern. Each milestone records a start and end time; git commit times are the fallback.

Entry format: what we built, what was hard, what AI did well, where the owner stepped in.

## Milestone 0: Local infrastructure

**Started:** 2026-10-31 12:07 EDT
**Ended:** —

### 2026-10-31 — Kickoff
- **Built:** nothing yet. Claude read SPEC.md v1.0 in full, summarized it back, and proposed a plan for the eight infrastructure steps.
- **Hard:** a few gaps between the spec and the setup steps surfaced before any code: TypeScript for Node code needs `@types/node`, which isn't on the approved list; the Neon Marketplace integration needs a Vercel project to attach to, which comes earlier than step 7; and where `styles/tokens.css` lives relative to the served folder. Raised as questions rather than resolved.
- **AI did well:** caught the missing `@types/node` before it turned into a type-check failure, and noticed the step order didn't match how the Marketplace works.
- **Owner stepped in:** answered all five questions. Approved `@types/node@24`, moved the decisions into their own DECISIONS.md, chose push-to-deploy from GitHub with Neon preview branches turned off, and confirmed the tokens path. SPEC bumped to v1.1.

### 2026-10-31 — Group A: tools
- Node 24.21.0, npm 11.19.0, git 2.56.0, and gh 2.103.3 (logged in as derekpcollins over SSH) were all present. The Vercel CLI wasn't installed.
- The owner installed Vercel CLI 65.9.0 globally and logged in as derekpcollins. It's installed under fnm's Node 24, so switching Node versions would hide it.
- Owner decision: previews use the `dev` database, so only production touches `main` (DECISIONS #25).

### 2026-10-31 — Group B: repo
- **Built:** `git init` on `main`, a `.gitignore` (env files, `.local-uploads/`, build output, Vercel and Playwright folders), and a POSIX-shell pre-commit hook in versioned `.githooks/`. The hook blocks `.env*` files and Postgres URLs that contain credentials.
- **Tested:** the hook blocked a staged `.env` file and a fake database URL, let the real files through, and blocked a real `git commit` of `.env.local`.
- **Hard / caught:** the first version of the hook printed 40 characters of the offending line, which could show part of a real password in the terminal. Changed it to print only `file:line`. The global git email was the placeholder `you@example.com`, so the first commit is on hold until the owner picks an address.
- **Owner stepped in:** set the global git email to the GitHub noreply address (`577782+derekpcollins@…`, checked against `gh api user`) and approved creating the public repo with the owner's description.
