# Kestrel Gives — Build Log

A running, honest record of how this project was built, for the case study. Times are US Eastern. Each milestone records a start and end time; git commit times are the fallback.

Entry format: what we built, what was hard, what AI did well, where the owner stepped in.

## Milestone 0: Local infrastructure

**Started:** 2026-10-31 12:07 EDT
**Ended:** —

### 2026-10-31 — Kickoff
- **Built:** nothing yet. Claude read SPEC.md v1.0 in full, summarized it back, and proposed a plan for the eight infrastructure steps.
- **Hard:** a few gaps between the spec and the setup steps surfaced before any code: TypeScript for Node code needs `@types/node`, which isn't on the approved list; the Neon Marketplace integration needs a Vercel project to attach to, which comes earlier than step 7; and where `styles/tokens.css` lives relative to the served folder. Raised as questions rather than resolved.
- **AI did well:** caught the missing `@types/node` before it turned into a type-check failure, and noticed the step order didn't match how the Marketplace works.
- **Owner stepped in:** answered all five questions. Approved `@types/node@24`, moved the decisions into their own DECISIONS.md, chose push-to-deploy from GitHub with Neon preview branches turned off, and confirmed the tokens path. SPEC bumped to v1.1.

### 2026-10-31 — Group A: tools
- Node 24.21.0, npm 11.19.0, git 2.56.0, and gh 2.103.3 (logged in as derekpcollins over SSH) were all present. The Vercel CLI wasn't installed.
- The owner installed Vercel CLI 65.9.0 globally and logged in as derekpcollins. It's installed under fnm's Node 24, so switching Node versions would hide it.
- Owner decision: previews use the `dev` database, so only production touches `main` (DECISIONS #25).

### 2026-10-31 — Group B: repo
- **Built:** `git init` on `main`, a `.gitignore` (env files, `.local-uploads/`, build output, Vercel and Playwright folders), and a POSIX-shell pre-commit hook in versioned `.githooks/`. The hook blocks `.env*` files and Postgres URLs that contain credentials.
- **Tested:** the hook blocked a staged `.env` file and a fake database URL, let the real files through, and blocked a real `git commit` of `.env.local`.
- **Hard / caught:** the first version of the hook printed 40 characters of the offending line, which could show part of a real password in the terminal. Changed it to print only `file:line`. The global git email was the placeholder `you@example.com`, so the first commit is on hold until the owner picks an address.
- **Owner stepped in:** set the global git email to the GitHub noreply address (`577782+derekpcollins@…`, checked against `gh api user`) and approved creating the public repo with the owner's description.

### 2026-10-31 — Group C: structure
- **Built:** the folder layout (`api/`, `lib/`, `src/` → `public/js/`, `public/styles/tokens.css`, `migrations/`, `scripts/`, `tests/unit`, `tests/e2e`), `package.json` with exactly the six approved packages, two strict tsconfigs, and `vercel.json` (no framework, `public/` as output). `npm run check:types` and `npm run build` both pass, and a deliberate type error fails the check.
- **Surprised:** `npm view` shows TypeScript is now on 7.0 (the native compiler). It worked with our config without changes.
- **Hard / caught:** `npm audit` reports a high-severity advisory in `zod`, pulled in by `@vercel/blob` → `@vercel/oidc` → `@vercel/cli-config`, which pins `zod@4.1.11` exactly. Raised with the owner instead of running `npm audit fix --force`, which would quietly downgrade `@vercel/blob`.
- **Owner stepped in:** accepted the zod advisory with a recheck at each milestone (#27), had TypeScript pinned exactly to 7.0.2 (#28), and set the push rule: commit freely, but push to `main` only after a checkpoint is approved, so the live demo only changes at checkpoints.
- **Owner stepped in (push rule correction):** under the push-at-each-checkpoint rule, approving Group D would have deployed. For the rest of infrastructure setup, pushes to `main` are on hold until Group G, which makes step 7 the real first deploy. After that, pushes go back to happening at each approved checkpoint.

### 2026-10-31 — Group D: database (in progress)
- **Vercel project:** created `kestrel-gives` on Derek's Projects (Hobby). `vercel link` also connected the GitHub repo (production branch `main`) on its own. Confirmed no deployment started.
- **Surprised:** `vercel link` did more than link. It wrote `.env.local` with a `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` and appended `.vercel` and `.env*` to `.gitignore`. Those duplicated existing rules, so the edit was reverted (both are still ignored). The project also defaulted to Node 26.x; set to 24.x to match `engines` and the local runtime.
- **Neon:** the owner accepted Neon's Marketplace terms personally. Installed `kestrel-gives-db` (Free plan `free_v3`, region iad1, Neon Auth and Realtime off), connected to Production only with no env pull. 16 env variables were created, all in Production; Preview and Development have none, and `.env.local` is untouched.
- **Hard:** neither the Vercel CLI nor the store API exposes Neon's "create a database branch per deployment" setting. Since the connection is Production-only, preview deployments get no Neon variables, but the toggle itself has to be checked in the dashboard.
- **dev branch:** the owner created `dev` from `main` in the Neon console and changed its auto-delete from Neon's default of 1 day to Never (#29). The owner couldn't find the dashboard's preview-branching toggle, so the check moves to Group G: list Neon branches after the first deploy and flag anything other than `main` and `dev`.
- **Hard:** copying the `dev` connection string by clipboard (`pbpaste`) failed twice. Both times the clipboard held other text (647, then 268 bytes, with no Postgres URL). The format check caught it before anything was written.
- **Third clipboard try worked.** The owner re-copied, and the script was changed to find the URL anywhere in the copied text. `.env.local` got the `dev` URL; Vercel Preview (stored as a secret) and Development got `DATABASE_URL`; the clipboard was cleared. `dev` (`ep-rough-smoke-…`) and `main` (`ep-super-wave-…`) are different endpoints. `main`'s URL was only ever in a temp file that was deleted right away.
- **Migrations and seed:** `scripts/migrate.ts` (a `schema_migrations` table, one transaction per file, a table lock so two runs can't collide), `migrations/001_init.sql` (placeholder `app_meta`), and a placeholder `scripts/seed.ts`. All go through a guard that refuses the `main` branch (#30). Tested: the guard blocks a URL with `main`'s endpoint and a missing setting; migrate run twice → "applied", then "Up to date"; seed run twice → still 1 row; a deliberately broken migration rolled back completely and wasn't recorded.

### 2026-10-31 — Group E: storage
- **Built:** public Blob store `kestrel-gives-blob` (iad1), with its token in Production and Preview only. The storage layer is `lib/storage/` (path rules, local driver, Blob driver, selector). Blob is used only on Vercel Production and Preview; everything else uses `.local-uploads/`. 17 `node:test` tests cover the prefix guard, the local driver, and which backend gets picked.
- **Owner stepped in:** connected Blob to Preview too, but required separate prefixes and a storage layer that can't delete outside its own prefix, with a test (#31). Decided seed photos are committed static files, not Blob (#32). SPEC bumped to v1.2.
- **Surprised:** `vercel blob create-store` also pulled the Development env variables into `.env.local`, which rewrote it and dropped its comments, and appended to `.gitignore` again. A backup taken just beforehand made it easy to check: `DATABASE_URL` still pointed at `dev`. Comments restored, `.gitignore` edit reverted, backup deleted. This is exactly the case the main-branch guard (#30) was built for.
- **Checked the tests catch a broken guard:** with the prefix check disabled, 12 of 17 tests failed; restored, all passed.
- **Placeholder:** nothing serves `.local-uploads/` over HTTP yet. That route comes in Milestone 5 along with uploads and the server-side type and size checks.

### 2026-10-31 — Group F: local dev
- **Built:** `scripts/dev.ts` (runs `tsc --watch` and `vercel dev` with prefixed output, stops both on Ctrl-C or if either dies), the `npm start` script, `npm run db:check`, a placeholder `public/index.html` with the footer disclaimer, and the README (with the clean-room sentence, setup, `.env.local` keys, and the rewrite warning). `NEON_MAIN_ENDPOINT` and `NEON_DEV_ENDPOINT` added to Vercel's Development environment (#34).
- **What was hard:** `npm run dev` wouldn't work with `vercel dev`. With a `build` script, `vercel dev` uses its static-build builder, which looks for a `dev` script and runs it. Ours led back to `vercel dev`, so the first symptom was a confusing `sh: yarn: command not found` (the project uses npm). Short experiments narrowed it down: an empty `devCommand` failed the same way; removing the `dev` script made everything work; making `dev` call `vercel dev` with `devCommand` running `tsc --watch` was refused outright with `DEV_RECURSIVE_INVOCATION`. The builder's source is in a cache folder outside the project, so it wasn't read (clean-room rule); Vercel's docs and experiments were enough.
- **Owner stepped in:** stopped the hunt for a way to keep the name `npm run dev` and chose the simplest working setup: `npm start`, with no `dev` script (#33).
- **Also caught:** Ctrl-C left `vercel`'s native child process running as an orphan. Fixed by starting each tool in its own process group and stopping the whole group. Retested: Ctrl-C stops everything, and killing `tsc` stops `vercel` too.
- **Tested:** `/` (200, footer present), `/js/main.js` (200), `/api/health` → `{"ok":true}`; editing `src/main.ts` showed up in the served file within seconds. `db:check` passes, and it fails clearly on a URL pointing at `main` or a missing guard setting.

### 2026-10-31 — Group G: first deploy
- **Health check:** `/api/health` now imports from `lib/` (to test `.ts` import extensions on Vercel), runs `SELECT 1`, and reports only a `main`/`dev` label (owner's call: no infrastructure IDs on a public site, #35). Locally: `{"ok":true,"db":"dev"}`.
- **The secret hook caught us:** the first commit attempt was blocked because the new unit tests used fake `user:pass@host` URLs. The fixtures were rewritten without credentials instead of loosening the hook.
- **First deploy:** pushed `main` at 12:59:28 EDT; production was Ready 12 seconds later at `https://kestrel-gives.vercel.app`. Checked: `/` 200 with the footer, `/js/main.js` and `/styles/tokens.css` 200, `/api/health` → `{"ok":true,"db":"main"}` with `no-store`. So Vercel's build handles the `.ts` import extensions.
- **Production migration blocked:** running `db:migrate --allow-main` against `main` was blocked by Claude Code's permission system as a production change. Left for the owner to run or allow. Not needed for health, which only runs `SELECT 1`.
- **Preview:** pushed the throwaway branch `preview-smoke-test`; the preview was Ready in 10 seconds. It's behind Vercel's deployment protection (302 to login), as expected. Protection left on; `vercel curl` not used, since it might create a bypass secret on the project. The URL went to the owner to check in a browser.
